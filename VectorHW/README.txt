Instructions:

Read all the numbers from the "numbers.txt" file into a vector.

Find the following statistics about the numbers in the vector:
-mean
-min
-max
-count (number of numbers)

write these statistics to a new file named "stats.txt"

Example "stats.txt" file contents:

min: 144
max: 9877
mean: 5273.95
count: 153

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Submission:

Turn in your main.cpp file, 
the Makefile that was given in the starter code, 
and the "numbers.txt" file.

Don't include the "stats.txt" file. When we run your code
it should produce a new "stats.txt" file in the same directory
as main.cpp

main.cpp is blank, write your solution in main.cpp

Be sure that the program runs when typing "Make". Cheap insurance
is to re-download your file after submitting it, and making sure it
runs correctly before the submission deadline.

Happy coding! :)
